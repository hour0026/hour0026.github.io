            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 20 year old student in Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. My hobbies include music production 
                and video games. I use software such as <abbr title="Fruity Loops">FL</abbr> Studio to create music. My dream is to make
                 it in the music industry, either as a performing artist or a producer, and inspire
            my fanbase and whoever else listens to my music. I take insipiration from artists such as <em>lostrushi</em>, 
            <em>i9bonsai</em> and <em>Lil Shine</em>.</p>.
            <p>I used to play the flute and piano, but find it hard to do so without bothering my roomates, so I gave up on those. 
                I do want to learn guitar, both acoustic and electric. The sounds and melodies they can create are really nice, and they
            are superp versitile instruments. I've also always wanted to play drums, but my parents wouldn't buy me or let me buy a drum kit
        as it was too loud. My computer let's me do that all in my headphones without bothering anybody.</p>
