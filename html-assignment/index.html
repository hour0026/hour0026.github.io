            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 20 year old student in Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. My hobbies include music production 
                and video games. My dream is to make it in the music industry, either as a performing artist or a producer, and inspire
            my fanbase and whoever else listens to my music. </p>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a creative, I always want to create something using my imagination, whether it's music, videos, 
                or even music videos. I've always wanted to show the world my work, whatever that may be.</p>
